// Package repos handles persistence for the lookup service: the
// CouchDB-backed (and in-memory, for tests) registration store and
// the filesystem-backed identity loader. Following the house style,
// repos exposes concrete structs and leaves interface definitions to
// their consumers in the domain package.

	// because the supplied _rev is stale. Callers should re-Get
	// the record and retry.
